# EcoSim

Notes / Work Status 
--------
Kyra: 
At this point in time, the files do not run. On Thursday (03/16), I plan to go to office hours to see if they can help get us started with a basic houdini plug in set up. 
I have added ECOSIMPlugin files, which are just copies of the LSYSTEMPlugin files. But, I think we should work there so we can still save the LSYSTEM files for reference as they are just in case. 
I have begun Subtask 1.1: Tree Data Stuctures. 
Currenly working on Subtask 1.3: Simulation Node Basic Structure. However, much of my syntax will be fixed on Thursday. I'm just getting a rough draft started.
